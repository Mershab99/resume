Dear UBS Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Java Spring Software Engineer role at UBS. With a strong background in developing high-performance microservices and deep expertise in Java Spring Boot, I am eager to contribute to your team’s success.

During my tenure at Nasdaq Inc., I engineered robust, high-throughput Java Spring Boot microservices, ensuring optimal efficiency and minimal memory impact. I played a key role in implementing critical financial business logic, such as Tailor Made Combinations (TMCs) and the FIX financial protocol, while increasing code test coverage to 85%. My experience in penetration testing, chaos testing, and performance optimization has strengthened my ability to build resilient, scalable systems that meet stringent SLAs.

Beyond my industry experience, I have worked with a diverse technology stack, including Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes, and various cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). My DevOps knowledge in GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, and ArgoCD further supports my ability to drive efficient software deployment pipelines.

I am highly passionate about crafting reliable and scalable software solutions, and I regularly sharpen my skills through my kubernetes based homelab. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your company’s goals. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Mershab Issadien
